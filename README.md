#### Your endpoint specialists' go-to UI
## The Challenge

Cisco ISE (Identity Services Engine) is **THE** policy engine for your network. It provides many (many) different services that are all required to meet today's user expectations while protecting the organization from threats:
* TACACS+/RADIUS for central management of networking equipment.
* Network Admission Control (NAC) identifying endpoints as they connect to the network (both wired and wireless).
* Group-based Policy using Cisco TrustSec.
* VPN policy with Cisco ASA/FTD.
* Guest lifecycle management.
* Device profiling.
* And more...

While Cisco ISE's richness of features and capabilities is highly appreciated by networking and security experts, endpoint technicians and helpdesk representatives prefer a simpler, limited GUI for their day-to-day tasks.

A specific capability asked by endpoint teams is the concept of a "voucher": a time-limited access token, given to a specific endpoint in order to grant immediate network access (while bypassing security checks) for a distressed user, allowing the technicians to remediate gaps in the endpoint's posture later.

## The Solution

Using Cisco ISE's open APIs, primarily ERS (External RESTful Services), we have created "Vanilla ISE": a simple UI for endpoint technicians and helpdesk representatives.

### Vanilla ISE's Capabilities:
* List the network access devices configured on ISE.

* Query a network device for current authentication sessions.

* Query a specific endpoint for details (status, NAD's IP and interface, authentication mechanism, username, and failure reason - if failed)

* Grant and revoke network access "vouchers".

## Running vanilla ISE:

There are several options for running vanilla ISE:
1. Running the code on a computer/server with Python.
2. Running the code on a Docker container. Requires to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/"> install Docker</a>.
3. Running the code on a Cisco device using Guestshell (Cisco Guestshell is a virtualized Linux-based environment, designed to run custom Linux applications, including Python for automated control and management of Cisco devices). See details below.

### Enable ISE ERS API

The ISE REST APIs (AKA External RESTful Services or ERS) are disabled by default for security. You must enable it:
1. Login to your ISE PAN using the admin or other SuperAdmin user.
2. Navigate to **Administration** > **System** > **Settings** and select **ERS Settings** from the left panel.
4. Enable the ERS APIs by selecting **Enable ERS for Read/Write**
5. Do not enable CSRF unless you know how to use the tokens.
6. Select **Save** to save your changes.

Note: its good practice to disable CSRF to make sure you are able to authenticate successfully.

### Set a environment variables file
```
ISE_IP= <ISE hostname/IP>
ISE_USER= <ISE username>
ISE_PASSWORD= <ISE password>
SWITCH_USER= <username for network devices>
SWITCH_PASS= <password for network devices>
SWITCH_ENABLE= <enable password for network devices>

* In the current version there is no need to provide ISE_USER and ISE_Password with environment file.

### Create a Docker image
`docker build -t VanillaLogin .`

### For persistant create docker volume on local OS 
docker volume create my-data
docker volume ls
docker volume inspect my-data

### Run the Docker
`docker run --rm -ti -p 5000:5000 --env-file ./env.txt -v my-data:/VanillaLogin/data main/vanilla-ise`
`docker run -d --env-file <path to env file> -v <path to data dir>:/Vanilla-ISE/data obrigg/vanilla-ise`

running the Docker in interactive mode:
`docker run -ti --env-file <path to env file> -v <path to data dir>:/Vanilla-ISE/data obrigg/vanilla-ise`
